I love solving problems with technology, whether that means designing a smarter AI chatbot for workplaces, building a sentiment classifier, or exploring ways to make tech more inclusive and responsible.

As a Break Through Tech Fellow, I’ve been growing my skills in machine learning, Python, and project management while collaborating with amazing peers and industry mentors to build AI projects with impact.  

Right now, I’m looking for new grad opportunities in product, data, or AI, somewhere I can keep learning and help build things that matter.

Featured Project: Application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for Medical Imaging
What We Did:
We explored how SVD, a linear algebra technique, can be used to compress grayscale medical images (like X-rays) while keeping critical details intact. By treating images as matrices and applying matrix decomposition, we were able to shrink file sizes by 58% without losing essential diagnostic features.

Tools Used: Python · NumPy · SciPy · PIL · Google Colab · Matplotlib
Results:

- Compressed a high-resolution X-ray to 42.02% of its original size

- Retained 90% of the image's visual data

- Demonstrated how SVD enables efficient storage and faster transmission of medical images

- Wrote a full Python pipeline to upload, grayscale, compress, and reconstruct images using SVD

- Visualized reconstruction quality at varying k values (number of singular values retained)

Why It Matters:
Hospitals generate massive amounts of imaging data. This project showed how a core linear algebra method could help reduce storage needs and costs while still supporting accurate diagnoses. It’s a great example of math + CS + healthcare coming together to solve real problems.

Fun Fact

When I’m not building something in Figma or exploring AI for social good, I’m probably cafe hopping around NYC, bonus points if they serve Yemeni coffee.
